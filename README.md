# 🌊 Flood Risk Dynamics Visualizations

This repository hosts the GitHub Pages site for the **Flood Risk Dynamics** project.

🌐 **Website**: [https://omidemam.github.io/flood_risk_dynamics.github.io/](https://omidemam.github.io/flood_risk_dynamics.github.io/)

The site presents interactive **risk maps** and visual summaries derived from large-scale flood modeling of culvert infrastructure across New York State.

🗺️ An interactive map that highlights spatio-temporal flood risk patterns across 2,200+ catchments.

At present, only the base map layers are visible. The complete results will be made available once the corresponding research paper has been published.
